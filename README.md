# NotBoringContent
Not Boring Content is a Godot project designed to help students learn programming.

MIT lisense for everything except pieces which I do not own: the background images and Chippy 3D model.


How it works: learning revolves around using createBox(x,y,z) to create boxes that appear in the 3D space.
This simple but intuitive function allows the teacher to visualize many programming fundamentals. 

This project requires Godot 3.5, which is less than 50 megabytes. 

Example 1:  Create a pyramid with code
